Link List is a array like sequence linked by pointer and wraped by struct.

Link List contains several data types, like int, float, double, char,......

But array just contains a data type.

Here are some cons and pros for array and link:

array pros
1. accessing data just needs O(1) time (Link List needs O(N))
2. less memory using (a pointer needs 4 bytes)
array cons
O(N) time to add/delete/move data (Link List needs O(1))

So if the data size has been known, then array is a better solution, or link list is better than array.
